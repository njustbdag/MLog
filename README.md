# MLog
Log anomaly detection based on MogrifierLSTM + CNN
MLog uses an innovative feature extraction method combining Bert pre training model and Event_IDF. The training model adopts the combination of MogrifilerLSTM + CNN.
MLog uses "CUDA" to train and predict under windows. The required Python package is in requirements.txt. Here, we would like to thank the following works:
